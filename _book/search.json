    "text": "1.2 Style Guide\n\n1.2.1 Content Guide\n\nMore descriptive is better than less. As this book is meant to form a compendium of knowledge, it should provide exquisite detail to provide a naive individual to come in and perform protocols in the same way as possible.\n…but too many words can lead to skimming. Like everything, there is a balance. Abbreviate when reasonable. Break up walls of text with bullets or lists when appropriate. Leading to the next point…\nGood figures are worth their weight in gold. It is often infinitely better to spend a good portion of time on a figure that is easier to describe or direct the reader’s attention to (ie ‘See Figure’). In the long run, this reduces the burden on you (textual descriptions of visual things are tiring) and on the reader (textual descriptions of visual things are often ineffective)\nReagent locations. I’m on the fence about locations of reagents because these things can be volatile. I would much rather supply catalog numbers and allow people to look up what they should be looking for, since these tend to be static. This means less book updating.\nUse archived links when possible. Use the WaybackMachine to either retrieve or generate an archived static version of a webpage you are referring to.\nNo rituals, please. When performing experiments, we often have ritualistic tendencies that end up having no effect on the final product. It’s one thing to provide a quick tip that provides better results. It’s another to provide arcane additional steps for no reason. Challenge your own rituals before you commit them to a protocol. Challenge what you think may be a ritual when you perform protocols. Strive for parsimonious protocols.\nLet operators save their own time. Unless the waiting period is huge (hours), avoid instructing operators to do something ‘while xyz’ is happening. People tend to figure this out on their own, and its inclusion muddies the protocol.\nProtocols don’t need to be the way you do them, but they need to work if you did.\n\n\n\n1.2.2 For the editor\nPrefer:\n\n‘seconds, minutes, hours’ to ‘sec, min, hr’\n{gt} or {flextable} to {kable}\n|> to %>%\n\\(\\mu L\\) to \\(uL\\) or uL\n\\(10000 \\times g\\) to \\(10K\\times g\\) \\(10K\\ g\\) or \\(10000g\\)\n\nAlso:\n\nSteps should generally contain one action, unless breaking the actions apart may mislead the operator (ie, do abc, then, with the same tip, do xyz)"
