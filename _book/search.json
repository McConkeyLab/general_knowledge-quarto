    "text": "1.2 Style Guide\n\nMore descriptive is better than less. As this book is meant to form a compendium of knowledge, it should provide exquisite detail to provide a naive individual to come in and perform protocols in the same way as possible.\n…but too many words can lead to skimming. Like everything, there is a balance. Abbreviate when reasonable. Break up walls of text with bullets or lists when appropriate. Leading to the next point…\nGood figures are worth their weight in gold. It is often infinitely better to spend a good portion of time on a figure that is easier to describe or direct the reader’s attention to (ie ‘See Figure’). In the long run, this reduces the burden on you (textual descriptions of visual things are tiring) and on the reader (textual descriptions of visual things are often ineffective)\nReagent locations. I’m on the fence about locations of reagents because these things can be volatile. I would much rather supply catalog numbers and allow people to look up what they should be looking for, since these tend to be static. This means less book updating.\nUse archived links when possible. Use the WaybackMachine to either retrieve or generate an archived static version of a webpage you are referring to.\nNo rituals, please. When performing experiments, we often have ritualistic tendencies that end up having no effect on the final product. It’s one thing to provide a quick tip that provides better results. It’s another to provide arcane additional steps for no reason. Challenge your own rituals before you commit them to a protocol. Challenge what you think may be a ritual when you perform protocols. Strive for parsimonious protocols.\nLet operators save their own time. Unless the waiting period is huge (hours), avoid instructing operators to do something ‘while xyz’ is happening. People tend to figure this out on their own, and its inclusion muddies the protocol.\nProtocols don’t need to be the way you do them, but they need to work if you did."

To do so:\n\nTransfer the medium from each well into a respective labeled 15mL conical.\nAdd \\(1mL\\) of PBS into each well\nTransfer PBS to its tube with the medium\nAdd \\(0.5mL\\) trypsin to each well\nIncubate at \\(37^\\circ C\\), occasionally checking and tapping the plate to dislodge loose cells.\nRemove the cell suspension from each well and transfer its tube\nAdd \\(2mL\\) medium to each well as a final rinse and transfer to its tube to neutralize the trypsin\nSpin down at \\(300 \\times g\\) for \\(5\\ minutes\\)\nAspirate supernatant\nResuspend in \\(1mL\\) PBS and transfer to a labelled microfuge tube\nSpin down at \\(300 \\times g\\) for \\(5\\ minutes\\)\nAspirate supernatant\nResuspend in \\(50\\mu L\\) RIPA\nFollow steps 4-8 of the above protocol\n\n\n\n\n6.2.2 Protein Quantification\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\n\nGet a bucket of ice and allow previously harvested protein lysates to begin thawing.\nTurn on a 1.5mL microfuge tube compatible heating block to \\(100^\\circ C\\).\nYou will need an additional sample per tube for this protocol. Label them accordingly.\nStart the protocol once the samples are thawed.\n\n\n\nWe use a modified protocol of ThermoFisher’s MicroBCA Assay (#23235).\n\n6.2.2.1 Prepare BSA standards\n\nPrepare 6 1.5mL microfuge tubes, labeled 2, 1, 0.5, 0.25, 0.125, and 0mg/mL\nAdd \\(1mL\\) diH2O to the 0mg/mL tube\nAdd \\(0.5mL\\) diH2O to all others except 2mg/mL tube\nBreak open an ampule of BSA (#23209)\nAdd the BSA to the 2mg/mL labeled tube\nTransfer \\(0.5mL\\) of 2mg/mL BSA to the 1mg/mL labelled tube. Pipette three times to ensure the residual concentration of BSA in the tip and in the tube has reached equilibrium.\nVortex 1mg/mL tube. Repeat steps to create a serial dilution. Do not add BSA to the final tube.\nStore tubes at \\(room temperature\\). These can be used for many assays.\n\n\n\n6.2.2.2 Running the Assay\nEach sample should be in triplicate. There are seven standards. Each sample requires \\(100\\mu L\\) reagent. With this in mind:\n\nIf you have \\(\\le9\\) samples, prepare \\(5mL\\) reagent.\nIf you have \\(10-25\\), prepare \\(10mL\\).\n\n\nPrepare an ABC reagent mixture (below, prepares 5mL)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n  \n    \n      \n      Volume\n      Ref #\n    \n  \n  \n    A\n2.5mL\n23231\n    B\n2.4mL\n23232\n    C\n0.1mL\n1859068\n  \n  \n  \n\n\n\n\n\nAdd \\(100\\mu L\\) ABC reagent to each well. See suggested layouts below.\nAdd \\(2\\mu L\\) of standard or sample to each well\n\nFor the 4mg/mL standard, add \\(4\\mu L\\) of the 2mg/mL standard\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShake in plate reader for \\(30\\ seconds\\)\nIncubate in incubator for \\(30\\ minutes\\)\n\nDuring this wait period, turn on a 1.5mL microfuge tube heating block to \\(100^\\circ C\\)\n\nMix plate for \\(10\\ seconds\\) prior to reading at \\(562nm\\)\nDetermine concentrations using this shiny applet\n\nSource code\n\nDilute samples with RIPA buffer as determined by the report output.\n\nIf you used the RIPA with Additives, use it to dilute your samples here.\n\nAdd one volume of sample buffer to each sample and vortex.\nBoil samples at \\(100^\\circ C\\) for \\(5\\ minutes\\)\n\nAdd a weight to the top of the sample lids to avoid them from popping open while heating\n\nCool on ice.\nVortex, then spin down.\nBoiled samples can be stored at \\(\\le-20^\\circ C\\).\n\n\n\n\n6.2.3 Running Gel\n\nObtain a gel tank, lid, gel holder, buffer dam (if only running one gel) and gels (from \\(4^\\circ C\\))\n\n\nGels come with different well sizes/numbers as well as agarose % - ensure you’ve gotten the right one.\n\n\nRemove bottom sticker and comb from gel, then insert gel into holder\n\n\nShould be flipped so that the numbers can be read from the outside\nPut buffer dam in at this time, if applicable\n\n\nFill inner chamber (between the gels/gel and dam) until it just overflows into the outer chamber and briefly check for leaks\nFill outer chamber to the 2 gels line (if running 1-2 gels) or 4 gels (if running 3-4 gels)\nIf using 10 lane gel, add \\(7.5\\mu L\\) ladder to at least one lane and \\(30\\mu L\\) of sample to the others\n\n\nIf you are running two gels and have the extra lane, it is helpful to run one ladder on one and two on the other to help differentiate them.\nAdd the two ladders to one side so you don’t make a confusing palindromic blot!\nIf using a 15 lane gel, use \\(7.5\\mu L\\) ladder to one lane and \\(15\\mu L\\) sample per lane for the rest.\n\n\nRun gel at \\(100V\\) for \\(90\\ minutes\\)\n\n\n\n6.2.4 Transfering Blot\n\nCut a membrane (either nitrocellulose or PVDF) to the size of a filter paper\n\n\nIf using PVDF, place it in a plastic case and pour methanol on top - let soak for \\(1\\ minute\\), then in transfer buffer for \\(7\\ minutes\\)\n\n\nPour a sufficient amount of transfer buffer into a sufficiently large container (usually \\(\\sim 1L\\) buffer - should be large enough to accommodate an unfolded transfer cassette)\nThe completed sandwich will be as follows, starting from the bottom: Black side of cassette, sponge, thick filter paper, gel, membrane, thick filter paper, sponge, clear side of cassette.\n\n\nPut the open cassette into the transfer buffer, then add a sponge and thick filter paper to each side of the sandwich. Add the membrane of your choice to the clear face side of the cassette sandwich.\n\n\nFree gel from the plastic by cracking the plastic at arrows with the green tool\nGently cut off the top of the gel with a razor, removing the wells and giving a rectangular gel.\nPress the plastic-backed gel onto the membrane and firmly rub the plastic to adhere the gel to the membrane and be released from the plastic\n\n\nThe plastic provides an astounding amount of integrity to the gel, so don’t be bashful\nThis may require multiple tries\n\n\nGently sweep and pat your fingers on the gel to remove any noticeable bubbles\n\n\nThe gel is very fragile at this stage, so take great care not to tear the gel\n\n\nAdd the other thick filter paper on top of the gel, then the other sponge, then close the other side of the sandwich on top.\n\n\nEnsure that upon closing the cassette that gels position does not shift too dramatically. Ensure that the contents of the gel is shifted downwards (towards the hinge) so that everything is properly saturated with buffer while transferring.\n\n\nInsert the completed cassette into the holder, with the clear face pointing towards the red side of the holder, black facing black\nInsert the cassette and holder into the tank, ensuring the red side of the holder encircles the red bar on the tank, and black on black.\nGrab two small freeze packs from the freezer and place them in the tank, upright, side by side.\nPour the transfer buffer you prepared your sandwich into the tank until it reaches the ‘transfer’ line\nFrom here, you can run the gel at \\(100V\\) for \\(1\\ hour\\) or \\(30V\\) \\(overnight\\).\n\n\nIf you choose to run at \\(100V\\), place the entire tank into an ice bucket and pour ice around it.\nIf you choose to run at \\(30V\\), put it in the refrigerator\nIf you are blotting for larger proteins (eg FGFR3) you may want to do a 2 hour transfer instead.\n\n\nOnce the transfer is done, open the sandwich and transfer the membrane to a plastic case. Pour TBS-T on top or move immediately into Ponceau staining.\n\n\n\n6.2.5 Ponceau Staining\n\nAdd enough Ponceau to cover the membrane and rock for \\(5\\ minutes\\)\nObserve staining patterns, checking for even protein amount in each lane\nCut the excess membrane off with a razor.\nPour Ponceau into a 50mL conical tube wrapped in foil. Store at \\(room\\ temperature\\). This can be reused near indefinitely.\nTransfer blot into a more suitably sized plastic case, if necessary.\nPour in enough TBS-T to comfortably cover the blot. Rock at \\(60rpm\\) for \\(5\\ minutes\\). Repeat for a total of three washes.\n\n\nCovering with TBS-T and rocking for 5min will henceforth be called a ‘wash’\nPour used TBS-T into the waste container\n\n\n\n6.2.6 Blocking\n\nIncubate membrane with \\(10mL\\) 1x Casein for \\(1\\ hour\\), up to \\(overnight\\), rocking at \\(RT\\)\nWash 3x\n\n\n\n6.2.7 Primary Antibody\n\nIncubate membrane with \\(1^\\circ\\) antibody in \\(10mL\\) casein for \\(2\\ hours\\)\n\n\nGenerally you should dilute the antibody 1:1000\nIf using anti-actin, incubate for only \\(1\\ hour\\) and dilute 1:2000\n\n\nWash 3x\n\n\n\n6.2.8 Secondary Antibody\n\nIncubate membrane with \\(2^\\circ\\) antibody in \\(10mL\\) casein for \\(1\\ hour\\)\n\n\nGenerally you should dilute the antibody 1:5000\nGenerally you will use Goat-Anti-Rabbit, but this depends entirely on your primary antibody\n\n\nWash 3x\n\n\n\n6.2.9 Detection\nThe detection method you use depends on the secondary antibody you use. If you use a secondary antibody with an HRP conjugate, you’ll need to use the ChemiDoc. If you use a fluorescent antibody, you’ll want to use the LI-COR. Note that you cannot use any fluorescent antibody - it needs to be LI-COR compatible, which usually means it has to be purchased from LI-COR.\n\n6.2.9.1 ChemiDoc\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWarning\n\n\n\nUse gloves when working with the ChemiDoc - EtBr is handled there (even though it is not carcinogenic - see here)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nTurn on ChemiDoc by flicking the switch on the black left of the machine. The power light on front should be green.\nPlug in the camera. The plug and power brick should be directly left to the machine.\nEnsure the camera filter lever is pulled forward (just below and to the right of the camera at the top of the machine)\nIf you haven’t created a protocol before, do so now (see below)\n\n\n\n6.2.9.1.1 Creating a Protocol\n\nOpen ImageLab\nClick “Create a new protocol”\nUnder “Application”, Select -> Blots -> Chemi Hi Resolution\nLeave Image Area as it is (9.0x6.7)\nSingle Accumulation Mode\n\n\nChoose the parameters that suit you best. I have 10, 300, and 10 as the fields for first and last image time, and Total Number of Images.\n\n\nSave the protocol in your folder (make one if you do not have one)\n\n\n\n6.2.9.1.2 Adding ECL\n\nPrepare a 1:1 working solution of ECL substrate, roughly 1mL solution per blot. Mix by pipetting.\n\n\nAmersham (#RPN3243) is the weakest and can be used for actin or very abundant proteins/good antibodies\nSignalFire is moderately sensitive. It’s a good starting place for non-actin antibodies.\nImmobilon (#WBUL20100) is good for detecting weak signals\n\n\nAdd ECL to blot, ensuring even coverage. Incubate for \\(2\\ minutes\\) (usually the time it takes to walk to the ChemiDoc).\n\n\n\n6.2.9.1.3 Capturing Images\n\nTake the blot to the ChemiDoc.\nOpen the drawer on the bottom of the ChemiDoc\nPlace blot in center\nClick “Align Blot” in ImageLab to ensure blot is centered. Adjust blot until it is centered.\nClick “Run protocol”\nWait until the protocol has accumulated to your satisfaction1\nClick ’Stop acquiring and continue with selected”\nUnder application, click: Select -> Custom -> epi\nRun protocol\nSave both images by selecting each window of the image in turn and pressing Ctrl + s.\nAdditionally, select each window and click “Screenshot” in the upper menu. Save “to file”\nRemove blot\nTurn off machine. Unplug camera. Close Image Lab. Do not save protocol.\n\n1 I usually stop at the first sign of over saturation (in red), then select the image right before.\n\n\n6.2.9.2 LI-COR"
