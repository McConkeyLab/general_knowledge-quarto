    "text": "1.2 Style Guide\n\nMore descriptive is better than less. As this book is meant to form a compendium of knowledge, it should provide exquisite detail to provide a naive individual to come in and perform protocols in the same way as possible.\n…but too many words can lead to skimming. Like everything, there is a balance. Abbreviate when reasonable. Break up walls of text with bullets or lists when appropriate. Leading to the next point…\nGood figures are worth their weight in gold. It is often infinitely better to spend a good portion of time on a figure that is easier to describe or direct the reader’s attention to (ie ‘See Figure’). In the long run, this reduces the burden on you (textual descriptions of visual things are tiring) and on the reader (textual descriptions of visual things are often ineffective)\nReagent locations. I’m on the fence about locations of reagents because these things can be volatile. I would much rather supply catalog numbers and allow people to look up what they should be looking for, since these tend to be static. This means less book updating.\nUse archived links when possible. Use the WaybackMachine to either retrieve or generate an archived static version of a webpage you are referring to.\nNo rituals, please. When performing experiments, we often have ritualistic tendencies that end up having no effect on the final product. It’s one thing to provide a quick tip that provides better results. It’s another to provide arcane additional steps for no reason. Challenge your own rituals before you commit them to a protocol. Challenge what you think may be a ritual when you perform protocols. Strive for parsimonious protocols.\nLet operators save their own time. Unless the waiting period is huge (hours), avoid instructing operators to do something ‘while xyz’ is happening. People tend to figure this out on their own, and its inclusion muddies the protocol.\nProtocols don’t need to be the way you do them, but they need to work if you did."

Add the membrane of your choice to the clear face side of the cassette sandwich.\n\n\nFree gel from the plastic by cracking the plastic at arrows with the green tool\nGently cut off the top of the gel with a razor, removing the wells and giving a rectangular gel.\nPress the plastic-backed gel onto the membrane and firmly rub the plastic to adhere the gel to the membrane and be released from the plastic\n\n\nThe plastic provides an astounding amount of integrity to the gel, so don’t be bashful\nThis may require multiple tries\n\n\nGently sweep and pat your fingers on the gel to remove any noticeable bubbles\n\n\nThe gel is very fragile at this stage, so take great care not to tear the gel\n\n\nAdd the other thick filter paper on top of the gel, then the other sponge, then close the other side of the sandwich on top.\n\n\nEnsure that upon closing the cassette that gels position does not shift too dramatically. Ensure that the contents of the gel is shifted downwards (towards the hinge) so that everything is properly saturated with buffer while transferring.\n\n\nInsert the completed cassette into the holder, with the clear face pointing towards the red side of the holder, black facing black\nInsert the cassette and holder into the tank, ensuring the red side of the holder encircles the red bar on the tank, and black on black.\nGrab two small freeze packs from the freezer and place them in the tank, upright, side by side.\nPour the transfer buffer you prepared your sandwich into the tank until it reaches the ‘transfer’ line\nFrom here, you can run the gel at \\(100V\\) for \\(1\\ hour\\) or \\(30V\\) \\(overnight\\).\n\n\nIf you choose to run at \\(100V\\), place the entire tank into an ice bucket and pour ice around it.\nIf you choose to run at \\(30V\\), put it in the refrigerator\nIf you are blotting for larger proteins (eg FGFR3) you may want to do a 2 hour transfer instead.\n\n\nOnce the transfer is done, open the sandwich and transfer the membrane to a plastic case. Pour TBS-T on top or move immediately into Ponceau staining.\n\n\n\n8.2.5 Visualizing transfer efficiency with Ponceau\n\nAdd enough Ponceau to cover the membrane and rock for \\(\\sim 5\\ minutes\\)\nPour Ponceau into a 50mL conical tube wrapped in foil. Store at \\(room\\ temperature\\). This can be reused near indefinitely.\nAdd a small amount of TBS-T and rock briefly (\\(\\sim 10\\ sec\\)) to excess stain\nObserve staining patterns, checking for even protein amount in each lane\nCut the excess membrane off with a razor.\nTransfer blot into a more suitably sized plastic case, if necessary.\nPour in enough TBS-T to comfortably cover the blot. Rock at \\(60rpm\\) for \\(5\\ minutes\\). Repeat for a total of three washes.\n\n\nCovering with TBS-T and rocking for 5 minutes will henceforth be called a ‘wash’\nPour used TBS-T into the waste container\n\n\n\n8.2.6 Blocking\n\nIncubate membrane with \\(10mL\\) 1x Casein for \\(1\\ hour\\), up to \\(overnight\\), rocking at \\(RT\\)\nWash 3x\n\n\n\n8.2.7 Primary Antibody\n\nIncubate membrane with \\(1^\\circ\\) antibody in \\(10mL\\) casein for \\(2\\ hours\\)\nWash 3x\n\n\n\n8.2.8 Secondary Antibody\n\nIncubate membrane with \\(2^\\circ\\) antibody in \\(10mL\\) casein for \\(1\\ hour\\)\nWash 3x\n\n\n\n8.2.9 Detection\nThe detection method you use depends on the secondary antibody you use. If you use a secondary antibody with an HRP conjugate, you’ll need to use the ChemiDoc. If you use a fluorescent antibody, you’ll want to use the LI-COR. Note that you cannot use any fluorescent antibody - it needs to be LI-COR compatible, which usually means it has to be purchased from LI-COR.\n\n8.2.9.1 ChemiDoc\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWarning\n\n\n\nUse gloves when working with the ChemiDoc - EtBr is handled there (even though it is not carcinogenic - see here)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nTurn on ChemiDoc by flicking the switch on the black left of the machine. The power light on front should be green.\nPlug in the camera. The plug and power brick should be directly left to the machine.\nEnsure the camera filter lever is pulled forward (just below and to the right of the camera at the top of the machine)\nIf you haven’t created a protocol before, do so now (see below)\n\n\n\n8.2.9.1.1 Creating a Protocol\n\nOpen ImageLab\nClick “Create a new protocol”\nUnder “Application”, Select -> Blots -> Chemi Hi Resolution\nLeave Image Area as it is (9.0x6.7)\nSingle Accumulation Mode\n\n\nChoose the parameters that suit you best. I have 10, 300, and 10 as the fields for first and last image time, and Total Number of Images.\n\n\nSave the protocol in your folder (make one if you do not have one)\n\n\n\n8.2.9.1.2 Adding ECL\n\nPrepare a 1:1 working solution of ECL substrate, roughly 1mL solution per blot. Mix by pipetting.\n\n\nAmersham (#RPN3243) is the weakest and can be used for actin or very abundant proteins/good antibodies\nSignalFire is moderately sensitive. It’s a good starting place for non-actin antibodies.\nImmobilon (#WBUL20100) is good for detecting weak signals\n\n\nAdd ECL to blot, ensuring even coverage. Incubate for \\(2\\ minutes\\) (usually the time it takes to walk to the ChemiDoc).\n\n\n\n8.2.9.1.3 Capturing Images\n\nTake the blot to the ChemiDoc.\nOpen the drawer on the bottom of the ChemiDoc\nPlace blot in center\nClick “Align Blot” in ImageLab to ensure blot is centered. Adjust blot until it is centered.\nClick “Run protocol”\nWait until the protocol has accumulated to your satisfaction3\nClick ’Stop acquiring and continue with selected”\nUnder application, click: Select -> Custom -> epi\nRun protocol\nSave both images by selecting each window of the image in turn and pressing Ctrl + s.\nAdditionally, select each window and click “Screenshot” in the upper menu. Save “to file”\nRemove blot\nTurn off machine. Unplug camera. Close Image Lab. Do not save protocol.\n\n3 I usually stop at the first sign of over saturation (in red), then select the image right before.\n\n\n8.2.9.2 LI-COR\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nBefore you use the LI-COR, you should make sure you: 1. Ask the Pienta-Amend lab if it’s ok 2. Ask to be added to the LI-COR signup calendar 3. Sign up for time on the LI-COR\n\n\n\nOpen Image Studio\nOpen your profile or create one if you don’t have one\nOpen the blot scanner lid\nIf necessary, squirt some diH2O on the scanning surface and wipe it down with a kimwipe.\nPlace the blot so that the protein is on the glass, the top edge of the blot is on the bottom edge of the scanning surface, and the blot is past the arrow in the corner both vertically and horizontally.\nIf there are any bubbles, use the roller to roll the blot flat.\nTake note of how many ‘ticks’ tall and wide the blot is, then make a rectangular section of that size in Image Studio.\nClose the scanner lid.\nStart the scan.\nOnce the scan is finished, click the yellow “IS” button.\nExport the scan."

This score ranges from 0 (very poor integrity) to 10 (very good integrity). In RNA extracted from cell lines, you should expect a value close to 10. However, for RNA isolated from FFPE samples, you can expect an RINe of around 1-2. Being in FFPE is very tough on samples, so there is a lot of fragmentation. Therefore, we accept these lower values.\nSince the RINe value is of little use to us in values that are highly degraded, we instead use the DV200. The DV200 is the percent of RNA fragments that are > 200 nucleotides in length. Traditionally, we accept DV200 values that are greater than 30%.\n\n\n\n12.2.3 DNA\nLibraries form a smooth peak at around 3000nt.
