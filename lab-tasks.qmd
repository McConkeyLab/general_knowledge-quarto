# General Lab Tasks

## Refilling 70% EtOH

70% ethanol is used for disinfecting. We store a large^[But not too large - health and safety will not allow for a larger EtOH reservoir than we currently have] bottle of ethanol near the sink.

To make more:

1. Add 70% (by volume) ethanol^[This is the CLEANING ethanol (large, multi-liter bottle) and not the molecular grade ethanol. Molecular grade ethanol should say it is molecular grade on the bottle.] and 30% water (normal tap water is fine) to a graduated cylinder.
2. Ensure that the bottom spigot of the large ethanol bottle is closed, then unscrew the lid.
3. Pour the 70% ethanol in the top
4. Screw the lid closed and give the ethanol bottle a little swirl.
5. Unscrew the lid slightly to allow air to come in to the top. Otherwise, a vacuum will form and ethanol can not flow out.
