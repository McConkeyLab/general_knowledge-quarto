# Cell Line Extraction Methods

## RNA (TRIzol)
[The following method is adapted from the Invitrogen TRIzol reagent user guide]{.aside}

:::{.callout-note}
Required Materials:
- TRIzol
- Chloroform
- RNase-free glycogen
- Isopropanol
- Freshly prepared 75% ethanol
:::

### Lysis and Phase Separation

Lyse and homogenize samples in TRIzol Reagent according to your starting material: 
#### Tissues
1. Add $1mL$ of TRIzol Reagent per $50–100mg$ of tissue to the sample and homogenize using a homogenizer

#### Cell grown in monolayer

##### Trypsinizing
If you are planning to measure GFP or you are isolating cells from one well of a multi-well plate e.g. during a time course experiment:

1. Trypsinize the cells and put them in a 1.5mL microfuge tube (this step is performed under the hood)
2. Centrifuge at $300\times g$ for $5\ minutes$
3. Aspirate the supernatant
4. Add $300\mu L$ TRIzol to the tube
5. Vortex

##### Direct Lysis
1. Aspirate the medium
2. Add $0.3–0.4 mL$ of TRIzol Reagent per $1 \times 10^5—1 \times 10^7$ cells directly to the culture dish to lyse the cells
3. Use a cell scraper to scrape the cells off the plate
4. Transfer the lysate to a 1.5mL microfuge tube  

#### Cells grown in suspension: 
1. Pellet the cells by centrifugation and discard the supernatant. 
2. Add $0.75 mL$ of TRIzol Reagent per $0.25 mL$ of sample ($5–10 \times 10^6$ cells from animal, plant, or yeast origin or $1 \times 10^7$ cells of bacterial origin) to the pellet.
3. Pipet the lysate up and down several times to homogenize

:::{.callout-note}
The sample volume should not exceed 10% of the volume of TRIzol Reagent used for lysis. 
:::

:::{.callout-note}
Samples can be stored at $4^\circ C$ overnight or at $–20^\circ C$ for up to a year. 
:::

:::{.callout-note}
If samples have a high fat content, centrifuge the lysate for $5\ minutes$ at $12,000 \times g$ at $4^\circ C$, then transfer the clear supernatant to a new tube
:::

Incubate for 5 minutes to permit complete dissociation of the nucleoproteins complex
Add 0.2 mL of chloroform per 1 mL of TRIzol™ Reagent used for lysis, then securely cap the tube
Vortex briefly
Incubate for 2–3 minutes
Centrifuge the sample for 15 minutes at 12,000 × g at 4°C. The mixture separates into a lower red phenol-chloroform, and interphase, and a colorless upper aqueous phase
Transfer the aqueous phase containing the RNA to a new tube
Transfer the aqueous phase containing the RNA to a new tube by angling the tube at 45° and pipetting the solution out
IMPORTANT! Avoid transferring any of the interphase or organic layer into the ppeĴe when removing the aqueous phase.

Isolate RNA
Precipitate the RNA
(Optional but HIGHLY RECOMMENDED) Add 5–10 µg of RNase-free glycogen as a carrier to the aqueous phase
Note: The glycogen is co-precipitated with the RNA, but does not interfere with subsequent applications
Add 0.5 mL of isopropanol to the aqueous phase, per 1 mL of TRIzol™ Reagent used for lysis
Vortex briefly
Incubate for 10 minutes
Centrifuge for 10 minutes at 12,000 × g at 4°C 
Total RNA precipitate forms a white gel-like pellet at the bottom of the tube. 
Aspirate the supernatant 
Wash the RNA
Resuspend the pellet in 1 mL of 75% ethanol per 1 mL of TRIzol™ Reagent used for lysis. Note: The RNA can be stored in 75% ethanol for at least 1 year at –20°C, or at least 1 week at 4°C
Vortex briefly
Centrifuge for 5 minutes at 7500 × g at 4°C
Aspirate the supernatant 
Vacuum or air dry the RNA pellet for 5–10 minutes
Tip: try flicking the tube to separate the pellet and aspirate the liquid
IMPORTANT! Do not dry the pellet by vacuum centrifuge. Do not let the RNA pellet dry, to ensure total solubilization of the RNA. Partially dissolved RNA samples have an A230/280 ratio <1.6
Solubilize the RNA
Resuspend the pellet in 20–50 µL of RNase-free water, 0.1 mM EDTA, or 0.5% SDS solution by pipetting up and down
IMPORTANT! Do not dissolve the RNA in 0.5% SDS if the RNA is to be used in subsequent enzymatic reactions
Incubate in a water bath or heat block set at 55–60°C for 10–15 minutes
Measure samples inn NanoDrop to check that your extraction worked
Proceed to downstream applications, or store the RNA at –70°C.


## RNA (mirVana)
[The following method is adapted from the mirVana miRNA Isolation Kit protocol]{.aside}

This kit is much more expensive per sample than TRIzol, but tends to produce purer results. It's typically only necessary for higher-stakes experiments like sequencing, but not for qPCR.

:::{.callout-note}
The night before, plate cells in a 6 well plate. 200K cells/well is a good number.
:::

:::{.callout-note}
* Get a bucket of ice
* Set the heatblock to $95^\circ C$ and add a microfuge tube with nuclease free H2O. You will need at least 50uL per sample - be generous with this!
* For each sample, label 4 tubes - two standard 1.5mL microfuge tubes, two collection tubes
:::


### Lysing Cells

1. Take 6 well plate from incubator. 
2. Aspirate off medium, then gently add $2mL$ PBS/well.
3. Aspirate off PBS, then add $300\mu L$ lysis buffer/well
4. Incubate at RT for $3\ minutes$
5. Use a cell scraper^[Cat# 83.3950] to scrape cells from the bottom of the well
* Don't forget to get all the edges
* Try not to let the scraper skip
* After scraping the bottom of the well, tilt the plate and sweep the lysate to the bottom to allow for easy transfer.
* Use a new scraper for each well
6. Transfer lysate to regular 1.5mL microfuge tube
7. Put on ice


### Organic Extraction

1. Add $\frac{1}{10}vol$^[A 'volume' refers to the pre-miRNA-Homogenate-Additive volume. If you follow this protocol, $\frac{1}{10}vol$ is $30 \mu L$] miRNA Homogenate Additive
2. Vortex $15\ seconds$
3. Put on ice for $10\ minutes$
4. Add $1\ vol$ phenol:chloroform

:::{.callout-warning}
Perform addition of phenol:chloroform and transfer of upper phase to a new tube under the fume hood - phenol:chloroform vapors are toxic.
:::

5. Vortex for $45\ seconds$
6. Centrifuge at $max\ speed$ for $5\ minutes$
7. Put phenol:chloroform away
8. Remove upper phase, transfer to fresh 1.5mL microfuge tube

:::{.callout-warning}
Err on the side of caution to avoid disturbing lower phase. As a rule of thumb, if you add 300uL lysis buffer, remove ~200uL. Your mileage may vary.

Make sure to note the volume of upper phase removed.
:::


### Total RNA Isolation

1. Add $1.25\ vol$ 100% EtOH
2. Vortex $15\ seconds$
3. Spin^[Henceforth for this protocol, 'spin' = $30\ seconds$ at $10000 \times g$] up to $600\mu L$ sample through filter cartridge into collection tube
4. Aspirate flow through
5. Add $600 \mu L$ Wash Solution 1, spin, and aspirate
6. Add $500 \mu L$ Wash Solution 2/3, spin, and aspirate
7. Add $500 \mu L$ Wash Solution 2/3, spin, aspirate, and spin for $1\ minute$
8. Transfer filter to fresh collection tube
9. Add $50 \mu L$ $95^\circ C$ H2O, spin
10. Measure concentration, 260/280, and 260/230 via NanoDrop

### TURBO DNA-free Treatment

[Adapted from Cat# AM1907 publication 1907M, revision H]{.aside}

:::{.callout-note}
- Remove reagents from refrigerator, leave on ice. 
- Turn heat block to $37^\circ C$ 
- Label one set of 1.5mL microfuge tubes, another set of 0.5mL microfuge tubes. 
- If you have many samples, a 96 well plate (with V bottoms) may be a better idea. 
- You should still prepare a set of labelled tubes for storage 
- If RNA concentration $>200ng/\mu L$, dilute to $200ng/\mu L$
:::

:::{.callout-tip}
Anywhere between $10-100\mu L$ sample is typical, with $50\mu L$ being typical
:::

1. Add $0.1\ volume$ of 10X TURBO DNase Buffer to RNA
2. Add $1\mu L$ TURBO DNase to RNA
3. Mix gently
4. Incubate at $37^\circ C$ for $30\ minutes$
5. Vortex DNase Inactivation Reagent to resuspend, then add $0.1\ volume$ (minimum $2\mu L$)

:::{.callout-tip}
If the reagent is dried up and can't be pipetted, determine how much volume of reagent there is, then add 25% of that volume of nuclease-free water.
:::

6. Incubate at $RT$ for $5\ minutes$, flicking every $1.5\ minutes$
7. Centrifuge at $10,000 \times g$ for $1.5\ minutes$ for 1.5mL tubes, or $2000 \times g$ for $5\ minutes$ for 96-well plates. 
8. Transfer supernatant to labelled tube for storage. Store at $\le -20^\circ C$

:::{.callout-warning}
Ensure you do not get any of the pellet.
